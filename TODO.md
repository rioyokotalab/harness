# Personal harness task board

This is the authoritative resume point for the portable Codex and Claude
harness. Keep only active decisions, blockers, exact next actions, and compact
completion pointers here. Full pre-housekeeping chronology is available at
published commit 90451d49ac96; detailed T-288 execution through Home Git
catch-up is preserved at 378df00159d59e8abee645f2bdaebd20cf467cc2. Final
T-288 through T-292 execution is in
`docs/audits/macos-ssh-finalization-2026-07-21.md`.

Next free ID: T-293.

## Current state

- Protected public `main` includes PR #185's functional closeout at b59ce7b,
  the schema-3 per-Mac SSH engine, and failover isolation. Superseded
  T-288/T-291/T-292 branches are absent locally and remotely.
- Managed Linux nodes are local, ab, ab2, ri, al, rc, and t4.
  abci_login and alps_login are transports, not targets; retired si is out of
  scope.
- T-288 through T-292 are functionally complete. Local, all six remote Linux
  nodes, and all four Macs have the canonical terminal SSH include and shared
  fragment. All four private Mac profiles use schema 3 with exactly four
  per-host SSH payloads and no legacy payload. Final execution preserved every
  Mac's distinct non-shared SSH bytes.
- The final Mac acceptance proved clean/current public and private Git, current
  updater/startup/SSH plans, managed non-login/login shells, both doctors, and
  zero formula-policy residue. Home's recurring known Codex-installer tail and
  duplicate link were remediated through the established exact transaction;
  no package or unknown state changed.
- The tmux session `harness-connection-monitor` probes Aist/Aist2,
  Office/Office2, riken/riken2, and Home/Home2 every 300 seconds. It reconnects
  a dropped primary through its secondary with `ssh login`, or a dropped
  secondary through its primary with `ssh login2`. It cannot recover a pair
  while both routes are down.
- Exactly one future native weekly primary backup job exists on each managed
  Linux node. First runs passed on 2026-07-19; keep-all remains effective.
- Global safety and collaboration invariants in `.codex/AGENTS.md` remain
  authoritative. Never inspect credentials or use raw recursive/bulk deletion.
- Whenever owner input/approval is requested or a task is completed, report a
  fresh health snapshot for all managed Linux nodes and all four Mac route
  pairs. Report transport aliases separately from managed targets.

## Next resume checkpoint

1. If the final audit-reference follow-up is not yet on protected `main`,
   publish it; otherwise guarded-synchronize only clean managed checkouts and
   revalidate the four Mac checkouts.
2. On or after 2026-07-26, query only T-196 recorded successor job IDs.
3. Select another independently eligible T-273 workstream only after fresh
   reconstruction of its gate and authority.

## Active tasks

### T-273 — Resolve intentionally deferred maintenance

**Phase/status:** executing. Workstreams 1, 2, 3, and 9 are complete. Each
remaining item keeps its independent gate.

1. **Failed transaction evidence — complete/retain.** Small paired recovery
   preimages lack a cleanup contract.
2. **Linux agent replacement — capability complete.** PR #143 published
   1ed9712bc8c3fd4896df2654b2a3379412e5984b; no live replacement or old-tree
   cleanup is authorized.
3. **Fourth Mac — complete.** T-268/T-269/T-286 acceptance passed.
4. **Backup successors — time-gated.** On or after 2026-07-26, query only the
   seven T-196 IDs; never duplicate a delayed job.
5. **Vendor arg0 directories — process-gated.** Re-inventory local only after
   every Codex process exits; use guarded-delete if eligible.
6. **Container capability — requirement-gated.** Install nothing merely for
   warning parity.
7. **One-way local-to-t4 SSH mirror — separate authority.** Execute only after
   explicit authorization for that external mutation.
8. **Package maintenance — freshness/selection-gated.** No blanket upgrade,
   cleanup, autoremove, cask, service, tap, or unmanaged-dependent mutation.
9. **Orphaned .bash_common — complete.** Absent on all four Macs; do not
   recreate it.

Closed non-goals remain plugins/connectors/accounts, administrator settings,
automatic publication, background login mutation, active-session reload, and
guessing lost unknown configuration.

### T-196 — Backup lifecycle phase 2

**Phase/status:** policy-resolved; execution remains gated on eight successful
weekly chains, two verified restores per node, and a current independent
generation. Progress is 1/8 everywhere.

| Node | Recorded 2026-07-26 successor |
| --- | --- |
| local | 91840 |
| ab | 2048464.pbs1 |
| ab2 | 2048468.pbs1 |
| ri | 7242 |
| rc | 212389 |
| t4 | 8194556 |
| al | 4238363 |

On or after eligibility, identity-match and query only these IDs. Record
terminal success, snapshot succession, warning silence, and chain count. Delay
is healthy; do not replace a pending job. Keep-all remains effective. No
forget, prune, recurring check/restore, or replica automation is authorized.
Evidence remains in docs/backup-lifecycle-phase2.md, docs/home-backup.md, and
docs/audits/restic-first-weekly-2026-07-19.md.

## Completed anchors

- T-292 isolated `login`/`login2` from multiplexing and enabled forward-bind
  fail-fast behavior in protected PRs #182 through #184, ending at 936a54f.
- T-291 converged the canonical SSH fragment on all eleven managed systems,
  published four distinct per-Mac payloads, finalized private schema 3, and
  preserved all live non-shared SSH bytes. Detailed execution and transaction
  identifiers are in `docs/audits/macos-ssh-finalization-2026-07-21.md`.
- T-290 diagnosed Aist route oscillation followed by the keepalive window. Its
  unpublished raw local checkpoint was compacted value-free and the sole
  preservation ref exact-deleted; no process/network details were published.
- T-288 completed post-onboarding Git, startup, doctor, and exact-residue
  housekeeping on all four Macs. The generic fix shipped in PR #170 and the
  final evidence is in `docs/audits/macos-ssh-finalization-2026-07-21.md`.
- T-289 published sourced harness-evolution artifacts in PR #168 at f2ffdd99685d;
  protected CI and clean phase-one passed.
- T-287 converged the fourth Mac startup files and published PR #166 at
  90451d49ac96.
- T-286 independently onboarded the fourth Mac and superseded T-285.
- T-284 published accelerated/instrumented cowork in PR #163 at 54454b3.
- T-283 published symmetric Codex-Claude cowork in PR #161 at 535a492.
- T-282 compacted the ledger and removed proven-obsolete refs in PR #159.
- T-281 completed three-Mac convergence; T-280 onboarded Home; T-279 repaired
  its prior Bash drift.
- T-274 published unified Bash startup and Mac onboarding; T-268/T-269
  completed the private Mac fleet.
- T-191 accepted first native weekly backup runs on all seven nodes.
- T-181 acceptance finished at 69/70 with zero safety failures.
- T-210 is complete and must not be repeated.

# Personal harness task board

This is the authoritative resume point for the portable Codex and Claude
harness. Git retains superseded chronology and command-level evidence. Keep
only active decisions, verified prerequisites, blockers, exact next actions,
and compact historical pointers here. Next free ID: T-193.

## Current state

- Repository: `main` at `303938f`, two local commits ahead of `origin/main`;
  pushing remains unauthorized. This TODO compaction is the only current
  worktree change.
- Managed environments: `local`, `ab`, `ab2`, `ri`, `al`, `rc`, and `t4`.
  `abci_login` and `alps_login` are transports; `github` and `web` are
  services. Retired `si` is not a target.
- All seven hidden-home Restic primaries and all seven independent encrypted
  generations have passed full-data checks and verified restores. Exact
  snapshot, fingerprint, aggregate restore, transaction, and cleanup evidence
  is retained in Git through `303938f` and in `docs/home-backup.md`.
- No recurring backup job, login-node cron, user timer, retention deletion, or
  automatic replica job exists. Recheck live scheduler state before T-191
  execution rather than relying on this statement.
- Global invariants remain authoritative in `.codex/AGENTS.md`: never inspect
  credentials; never use raw recursive/bulk deletion; preserve unrelated owner
  state; print native scheduler actions; validate proportional to risk; do not
  push without explicit authority.

## Recovery priority

- **T-172 — Exhaustively re-audit Git history (complete 2026-07-15):** audited
  both repositories' reachable graphs, refs, reflogs, read-only unreachable
  objects, historical task paths, and pre-/post-incident trees. No additional
  recoverable pre-incident home content or lost ShellCheck implementation was
  found. The website's eight damaged paths were already identical to commit
  `628b53a`; harness recovery and every later delta were reconciled. Four
  harness blobs and the website unreachable graph are superseded intermediate
  work, not recovery candidates. The ignored T-11 payload and former owner
  profiles remain unavailable; do not fabricate them. Git preserves the full
  candidate table and audit evidence in the pre-compaction TODO history.

## Active tasks

### T-191 — Scheduler-native weekly primary snapshots

**Status:** executing from the explicit owner `proceed` on 2026-07-16. Local,
AB, AB2, AL, RC, and T4 have passed the allocated read-only smoke and exact
successor-cancellation gate. RI is paused before submission because its live
Slurm policy requires an explicit project account, contrary to frozen D19;
ask the owner for that one material choice, then finish RI before seeding.

**Verified prerequisite:** every primary and independent generation has a
successful full-data check and verified restore. Recurrence covers primary
snapshots only; independent replica generations remain manual.

**Frozen global decisions (D1-D10, D27-D28):** run weekly and independently on
each node through its native batch scheduler. Do not use login-node cron,
`systemd` timers, central SSH, AL `scrontab`, sleeping processes, or automatic
logout work. Maintain exactly one future scheduler job per node. When admitted,
the job validates its identity, submits/adopts and records exactly one
successor, then runs one incremental snapshot. Valid pending/held state is
healthy even after eligibility; queue delay is not a failure and must never
create a duplicate. A job delayed past one or more Sundays runs one snapshot,
does not backfill, and selects the earliest designated Sunday strictly after
its actual start. Keep all snapshots initially: no `forget`, `prune`, retention
deletion, automatic replica, or scheduled full-data check. Record private local
status and warn only on a later interactive login; healthy and non-interactive
sessions remain silent.

**Frozen resource and eligibility matrix (D11-D26):** times are scheduler-local
eligibility points, not promised starts.

| Host | Native request | Sunday eligibility |
|---|---|---|
| `local` | `ybatch`; default account; `thrp_1`; 30 min; default priority; evidence-only fallback `epyc-7502_1` | 00:30 JST |
| `ab` | PBS `-P gag51395`; `rt_HC`; `select=1`; 30 min; default Spot priority | 01:00 JST |
| `ab2` | PBS `-P gah51624`; `rt_HC`; `select=1`; 30 min; default Spot priority | 01:30 JST |
| `ri` | Slurm default account/partition; one node/task/CPU; no GPU; 30 min | 02:00 JST |
| `rc` | Slurm `-A cloud-users -p r340`; one node/task/CPU; no GPU; 30 min | 02:30 JST |
| `t4` | AGE `-g jh250019 -l cpu_4=1 -l h_rt=00:30:00`; omit `-p` | 03:00 JST |
| `al` | Slurm `-A g177-1 -p normal`; one node/task/CPU; no GPU; 30 min | 01:00 Europe/Zurich local time |

Live read-only discovery on 2026-07-16 established the account/resource facts.
Notable tradeoffs: AL `normal` is whole-node exclusive but was explicitly
chosen; RC `r340` is shared x86-64 and matches the managed Restic binary; T4
`cpu_4` is its smallest documented CPU-only type and uses default priority;
`local` `thrp_1` requests no GPU despite GPU-bearing physical nodes. Every
claim is still acceptance-gated by its site's live smoke.

**Implementation plan:**

1. Add strict `profiles/restic-schedules.tsv` declarations for the exact seven
   rows above. Validate unique known hosts, safe fields, timezone, scheduler,
   account/group, resource, walltime, and priority schemas.
2. Add `harness restic-primary`: reuse the reviewed hidden-home algorithm from
   `docs/home-backup.md`; validate the repository row and password-file
   type/owner/mode without reading it; privately enumerate every top-level
   hidden path plus only approved relocated targets; run the managed Restic
   command with the password by pathname; exact-unlink the one manifest.
   Weekly tag: `harness-hidden-home-weekly`.
3. Add `harness restic-schedule` with read-only `plan`, `status`, and `warning`,
   plus explicit `smoke`, `seed`, allocated `run`, and exact-ID `disable`.
   Store mode-0600 atomic state below mode-0700
   `~/.local/state/harness/restic-chain/`; retain bounded, value-limited
   diagnostics and never log hidden-home contents or credential values.
4. Generate native jobs: Slurm `sbatch --begin` on RI/RC/AL; embedded
   `#SBATCH --begin` with `ybatch` on `local`; PBS `qsub -a` on AB/AB2; AGE
   `qsub -a` on T4. Print the resolved `NATIVE` command before every write.
5. Close the submit/record crash window with deterministic chain/host/
   eligibility job names. Query before submission and after ambiguous output:
   adopt exactly one matching owner/name/time job, submit only when none exists,
   and stop/warn on duplicates. Validate the running ID/name before any work;
   successor persistence precedes the snapshot.
6. Add a bounded call in `shell/interactive.sh`. It is silent when healthy or
   unseeded, performs no scheduler write/network/authentication/prompt, and may
   query only the captured local scheduler ID. Preserve silence in
   non-interactive, batch, nested, and ordinary SSH-command sessions.
7. Add fake-scheduler and source-manifest tests covering hostile output, ID
   parsing, modes/owners/symlinks, successor ordering, concurrency, ambiguous
   acceptance, queue delays, no-backfill, JST and Europe/Zurich DST boundaries,
   warning clearing, bounded history, exact disable, and absence of destructive,
   retention, replica, or secret-reading paths. Run syntax, warning-level
   ShellCheck, focused suites, `git diff --check`, guarded-delete tests, and
   `tests/test-phase1.sh`.
8. Commit only reviewed harness files locally; do not push. Revalidate every
   checkout is clean and logically identified, distribute the exact revision
   using the established credential-free Git-bundle/fast-forward route, and
   rerun plan/profile/PTY/non-interactive/status gates on all seven nodes.
9. Run bounded native smokes concurrently where policies permit. Each real
   allocation validates architecture, paths, password metadata only, managed
   Restic read-only access, time calculation, and one distant deferred test
   successor; it performs no snapshot. Cancel only that exact successor and
   prove it absent. A compute-side resubmission failure returns to the D9
   fallback interview; do not improvise a login trigger.
10. After all seven smokes and cancellation proofs pass, seed exactly one real
    future job per node, prove no duplicate exists, and monitor each first
    admitted snapshot plus strictly future successor. Queue delay is allowed.
    Keep T-191 verification-pending until all seven pass, with progress updates
    at least every five minutes during active monitoring.

**Stop and rollback:** dirty checkout, credential-path anomaly, unknown
resource, architecture mismatch, duplicate/ambiguous job, inaccessible
repository, failed smoke, or unexpected scheduler semantics halts only that
node without weakening checks. Before seeding there is no scheduler rollback.
After seeding, `disable` revalidates, prints, cancels, and verifies absence of
only the captured future ID, then retains private evidence. It never searches
broadly or deletes state.

**Execution checkpoint:** owner authority is limited to this frozen T-191 plan.
Current working set starts with `TODO.md`, `profiles/restic-schedules.tsv`,
`bin/harness`, new `libexec/harness-restic-primary` and
`libexec/harness-restic-schedule`, `shell/interactive.sh`, focused tests, and
the backup documentation. Next action is local implementation and validation;
do not submit a scheduler job before that checkpoint passes.

**Initial execution audit (2026-07-16):** exact-name process checks report zero
Restic processes on every node. Native scheduler listings filtered only to the
reserved `hr-*` namespace report no matching job on `local`, RI, AL, RC, AB,
AB2, or T4. X11-forwarding warnings on RI/RC were transport noise; every probe
otherwise completed. It is safe to implement locally; re-run this audit before
the first smoke because this checkpoint does not reserve scheduler state.

**Local implementation checkpoint:** the strict seven-row schedule, shared
primary helper, scheduler controller, interactive warning, documentation, and
focused fake-scheduler suite are implemented in the declared working set.
Syntax, warning-level ShellCheck for new scripts, `git diff --check`, the
focused suite, and guarded-delete suite pass. The first complete phase-1 run
reached the pre-existing environment gate and stopped exactly at
`tests/test-phase1.sh: 365: mpicc: not found`: the process-local module table
again claims OpenMPI is loaded without exporting its compiler. No scheduler
write occurred. A retry is safe only after unloading and reloading the same
declared `openmpi/5.0-cuda-12.8` module in the retry shell.

The reviewed retry and the later strengthened state-machine rerun both pass
the complete phase-1 suite with only the documented login-node CUDA-library
warnings. The focused suite now proves smoke-gated seeding,
`verified-disabled` successor cancellation, status tracking of the future
smoke successor, exact singleton/idempotent seed and disable across fake
`ybatch`/Slurm/PBS/AGE, hostile output refusal, successor-first weekly order,
JST/Europe-Zurich boundary behavior, private warning state, manifest coverage,
and relocated-target rejection. Read-only `plan`/`next` succeeds for all seven
declarations after fixing portable planning so it does not require a remote
site's scheduler directories locally. Next action: inspect and commit only the
declared implementation files locally; do not push.

**Rollout and pre-smoke checkpoint:** local implementation commit
`852b84bb753bf590a55353f96de71fba3b7b77d5` is clean and unpushed. A
43,655-byte credential-free bundle with SHA-256
`f4ca151b7007316d361aae5ad009759b62fda109d4361e0a37b8d848581c9c72`
fast-forwarded clean AB, RI, AL, RC, and T4 checkouts from `df72e17` and AB2
from `303938f` to that exact commit. Every remote bundle and the local bundle
are exact-unlinked and absent. All seven nodes then passed exact-revision and
clean-worktree checks, new-script syntax, schedule `plan`/`next`, absent chain
and smoke state, doctor, and managed Restic read-only repository access. Real
PTY-backed interactive shells remained warning-silent while healthy/unseeded,
and non-interactive shells remained silent on every node. AB2's first shared
validation connection outlived the result window but left no Restic process;
its bounded solo retry passed the full gate. No scheduler write has yet run.
Next action: commit this evidence locally, re-audit the reserved job namespace,
then submit the seven bounded smokes with the printed native commands.

**First live-smoke checkpoint:** the reserved namespace/process re-audit was
clean. AB parent `2043932.pbs1`, AB2 `2043931.pbs1`, AL `4220993`, RC
`210790`, and T4 `8175288` were accepted with their exact printed native
requests. AL and RC completed read-only Restic checks, created exactly one
Sunday successor (`4220994` and `210791`), and exact `scancel` plus absence
verification left both smoke states `verified-disabled`. AB/AB2 remain valid
queued parents and were not duplicated. Local failed before state adoption:
`ybatch` injected `thrp_1` directives after `set -eu`, so Slurm ignored the
partition and accepted no job. RI direct SSH lacked the site Slurm DNS/config
environment; native `scontrol ping` and `sbatch --version` pass under both
`bash -lc` and `bash -lic`, so retry must use the login environment and let the
smoke prove compute-side resubmission. T4 ran on `cpu_4=1` (four slots, no GPU)
for 0.93 seconds and exited 2 before advancing state; only `smoke-submitted`
exists, with no lock or diagnostic. This exposed missing private diagnostics.
Current corrective work moves local `#YBATCH`/`#SBATCH` directives before the
first executable line, adds ordering regression, overwrites one mode-0600
controller diagnostic per job, and safely reconciles an absent submitted smoke
as failed before retry. No snapshot has run and no uncaptured job was created.

**T4 retry checkpoint:** corrective commit `613a0f2` allowed a safe retry as
AGE job `8175315`. Its managed read-only Restic check passed, but compute-side
successor submission stopped before adoption because `qsub` was absent from
the batch job's `PATH`; the private mode-0600 diagnostic contains only the
resolved native command and the `command not found` error. Login-side
validation identified the executable directory as
`/apps/t4/rhel9/uge/latest/bin/lx-amd64`, a mode-0755 directory owned by
`geadmin` and canonically linked to the installed 2023.1.1 AGE tree. Commit
`4c678d5` declared that path, passed focused, guarded-delete, and complete
phase-1 gates, and was bundle-fast-forwarded to all six clean remotes. Retry
parent `8175392` then passed on `all.q/r2n6`, four CPU slots, exit 0 in 3.498
seconds; exact `qdel 8175400` verified its Sunday successor disabled.

**Six-node smoke checkpoint:** every accepted parent below completed the
managed read-only Restic check and created exactly one future Sunday successor;
each successor was canceled by captured exact ID and its private state is now
`verified-disabled`. No smoke took a snapshot.

| Host | Accepted parent | Exact disabled successor |
|---|---:|---:|
| `local` | `90931` | `90932` |
| `ab` | `2043932.pbs1` | `2043966.pbs1` |
| `ab2` | `2043931.pbs1` | `2043964.pbs1` |
| `al` | `4220993` | `4220994` |
| `rc` | `210790` | `210791` |
| `t4` | `8175392` | `8175400` |

Local parent `90931` completed in 12 seconds on `threadripper-3960x` with six
CPUs and 15,600 MiB; AL parent `4220993` completed in nine seconds with the
accepted whole-node allocation; RC parent `210790` completed in three seconds
with two billed CPUs; and T4 accounting is recorded above. All bundle copies
were exact-unlinked and every checkout is clean at `4c678d5`. RI reached its
scheduler only under the login environment and requires an explicit project
account; do not guess or seed any production chain until the owner resolves
that new choice and RI passes the same smoke gate.

### T-190 — Create automated mirrored-node onboarding skill

**Status:** PIE interview complete; separately awaiting an explicit owner `go`.
T-191 is currently ordered first. The skill does not onboard a node until the
owner supplies an already-configured SSH alias.

**Frozen decisions:** invocation is `onboard HOST`; the supplied alias is the
entire discovery boundary and the workflow must not read/enumerate SSH config.
Retain one owner-only checkpoint to create and externally retain a unique
mode-0600 Restic password; agents validate metadata and pass the path only.
First-run onboarding reaches full portable parity, approved storage migration,
primary full-data check/restore, and an independently restored encrypted
generation. Scheduling and unreviewed deletion remain excluded.

**Execution outline:** scaffold and validate
`shared/skills/onboard-mirrored-node`; reject malformed/reserved/proxy/service/
managed IDs; collect a value-redacted native inventory; use PIE one question at
a time only for unknown storage, hidden-state, replica, tool, or authority
choices; generate profile, home/Restic rows, shell/environment adapters,
sanitized fixture, documentation, and tests in narrow staging; derive managed
fleet membership from strict profiles rather than hard-coded link counts; run
all local/adversarial tests; commit locally without push; bootstrap by verified
Git bundle; perform remote plan before transactional apply; create roots and
migrate only approved high-growth paths with retained copies and guarded
deletion; validate shell/Vim/SSH fragments, current managed links, doctor,
idempotence, and interactive/non-interactive behavior; pause for the owner
password step; complete both restore gates; clean exact temporary artifacts;
and checkpoint final fleet evidence.

**Authority/stop rules:** never inspect/copy/generate credentials, automate
login UI, install as root, change site scheduler/runtime/driver configuration,
clone projects/data, run jobs, push/publish, enable scheduling, delete
unreviewed paths, or alter unrelated owner settings. Fail closed on identity,
dirty source, schema collision, canonical-home drift, quota/filesystem
uncertainty, symlink surprise, unsupported artifact, repository lock, source
drift, or validation mismatch.

**Next action:** after a separate owner `go`, scaffold the skill and implement
the local tests before requesting any onboarding alias.

### T-181 — Acceptance-grade harness evaluation corpus

**Status:** proposed; blocked on owner review; no implementation authorized.

Freeze representative safe tasks and compare the unchanged harness with one
candidate mechanism at a time in disposable worktrees/fake homes: (A) one
evidence-triggered retry capsule, (B) one read-only bounded subagent, or (C)
read-only lifecycle telemetry. Measure correctness, owner-style acceptance,
unintended diffs, recovery, time, tool/context cost, and failure mode across
repeated runs. Require zero safety regressions and no correctness loss. Do not
adopt product memory, recursive teams, always-on reflection, or hooks as a
deletion safety boundary without evidence and separate owner selection.

## Stable operational facts

- The 2026-07-15 accident was an agent-issued raw recursive deletion of
  `/home/rioyokota` after a temporary `HOME` assignment expired. Processes were
  terminated; no usable whole-home filesystem snapshot existed. Harness and
  website recovery are complete. Unknown former profiles and `sshservice-cli`
  remain intentionally unreconstructed.
- The guarded-delete schema protects lexical and canonical account homes,
  binds immutable manifests to exact identities/counts/bytes, revalidates
  immediately before apply, and verifies anchors afterward. RC and load-balanced
  AL require the documented canonical-home/persistent-session handling; never
  weaken the guard.
- `/mnt/nfs-03` is a hard NFSv4.2 mount whose metadata latency makes large
  small-file restore/cleanup trees extremely slow even when throughput and
  capacity are healthy. Keep packed repositories/generations on large storage
  and materialize restore tests on node-local mode-0700 scratch.
- AL authentication uses the owner's existing `id_ed25519` certificate renewed
  by `cscs-key sign --headless -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519`. The local `al` convenience
  alias is intentionally owner-only in the current node's `.bashrc` and must
  not be mirrored.
- AB2's 10 TB group quota is active. Its `.local` migration, approved cleanup,
  primary, independent generation, full-data checks, restores, and guarded
  cleanup completed under T-192. `.bash_history` remains node-local.
- `profiles/home-layout.tsv`, `profiles/restic-repositories.tsv`, host profiles,
  `docs/environment-portability.md`, `docs/home-backup.md`, and
  `shared/skills/operate-native-hpc/references/sites.md` are the canonical
  current declarations; do not copy obsolete ledger prose back into them.

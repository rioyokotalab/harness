# Personal harness task board

This is the authoritative resume point for the portable Codex and Claude
harness. Keep only active decisions, blockers, exact next actions, and compact
completion pointers here. Full pre-housekeeping chronology is available at
published commit 90451d49ac96; detailed T-288 execution through Home Git
catch-up is preserved at 378df00159d59e8abee645f2bdaebd20cf467cc2. Final
T-288 through T-292 execution is in
`docs/audits/macos-ssh-finalization-2026-07-21.md`.

Next free ID: T-295.

## Current state

- Protected public `main` includes PR #185's functional closeout and PR #186's
  durable audit, the schema-3 per-Mac SSH engine, and failover isolation.
  Superseded T-288/T-291/T-292 branches are absent locally and remotely.
- Managed Linux nodes are local, ab, ab2, ri, al, rc, and t4.
  abci_login and alps_login are transports, not targets; retired si is out of
  scope.
- T-288 through T-292 are functionally complete. Local, all six remote Linux
  nodes, and all four Macs have the canonical terminal SSH include and shared
  fragment. All four private Mac profiles use schema 3 with exactly four
  per-host SSH payloads and no legacy payload. Final execution preserved every
  Mac's distinct non-shared SSH bytes.
- The final Mac acceptance proved clean/current public and private Git, current
  updater/startup/SSH plans, managed non-login/login shells, both doctors, and
  zero formula-policy residue. Home's recurring known Codex-installer tail and
  duplicate link were remediated through the established exact transaction;
  no package or unknown state changed.
- Guarded fleet synchronization advanced all six clean Linux mirrors, and the
  schema-3 updater advanced all four clean Mac public checkouts without a live
  SSH transaction. Private Mac checkouts remained clean/current.
- All four Macs run two independent current-user `launchd` supervisors using
  dedicated restricted identities. The tmux session
  `harness-connection-monitor` probes every pair at 300-second cadence,
  classifies healthy/degraded/unrecoverable state, and uses only a healthy
  sibling to kick one failed service. Simultaneous route loss recovers locally
  through `launchd` without controller or owner intervention for tested
  process/network failures; power, sleep, and external-provider loss remain
  outside that guarantee.
- Exactly one future native weekly primary backup job exists on each managed
  Linux node. First runs passed on 2026-07-19; keep-all remains effective.
- Global safety and collaboration invariants in `.codex/AGENTS.md` remain
  authoritative. Never inspect credentials or use raw recursive/bulk deletion.
- Whenever owner input/approval is requested or a task is completed, report a
  fresh health snapshot for all managed Linux nodes and all four Mac route
  pairs. At the owner's standing request, omit `abci_login` and `alps_login`
  from routine health reports unless a task specifically targets a transport.

## Next resume checkpoint

1. Resolve T-294's local launcher-workaround authority boundary. Do not remove
   or replace the official standalone launcher without the owner's explicit
   choice.
2. Select another independently eligible T-273 workstream only after fresh
   reconstruction of its gate and authority.
3. On or after 2026-07-26, query only T-196 recorded successor job IDs.

## Active tasks

### T-273 — Resolve intentionally deferred maintenance

**Phase/status:** executing. Workstreams 1, 2, 3, and 9 are complete. Each
remaining item keeps its independent gate.

1. **Failed transaction evidence — complete/retain.** Small paired recovery
   preimages lack a cleanup contract.
2. **Linux agent replacement — capability complete.** PR #143 published
   1ed9712bc8c3fd4896df2654b2a3379412e5984b; no live replacement or old-tree
   cleanup is authorized.
3. **Fourth Mac — complete.** T-268/T-269/T-286 acceptance passed.
4. **Backup successors — time-gated.** On or after 2026-07-26, query only the
   seven T-196 IDs; never duplicate a delayed job.
5. **Vendor arg0 directories — diagnosed; durable fix separated as T-294.**
   The old process-wide gate was overly broad: held per-directory locks protect
   live sessions, while unlocked residue can be isolated and guarded-deleted.
6. **Container capability — requirement-gated.** Install nothing merely for
   warning parity.
7. **One-way local-to-t4 SSH mirror — separate authority.** Execute only after
   explicit authorization for that external mutation.
8. **Package maintenance — freshness/selection-gated.** No blanket upgrade,
   cleanup, autoremove, cask, service, tap, or unmanaged-dependent mutation.
9. **Orphaned .bash_common — complete.** Absent on all four Macs; do not
   recreate it.

Closed non-goals remain plugins/connectors/accounts, administrator settings,
automatic publication, background login mutation, active-session reload, and
guessing lost unknown configuration.

### T-294 — Eliminate Codex arg0 cleanup failures on local NFS home

**Phase/status:** diagnosed; one-time cleanup complete; durable launcher change
awaits an explicit owner choice.

- Local Codex CLI 0.145.0 stores its arg0 helper directories on the NFSv3
  account home. The mounted filesystem reports `local_lock=none`.
- Lock-aware inventory found 3,157 empty no-lock remnants, one unlocked stale
  helper directory, and three held-lock live directories. The live directories
  were preserved with unchanged identities and working helper paths.
- The stale set was atomically quarantined, then removed through guarded-delete
  manifest `/home/rioyokota/.codex/tmp/arg0-cleanup-20260722.manifest`:
  one target containing 3,158 child directories and 3,164 total entries. The
  manifest was exact-unlinked after its verified result was recorded here.
- Two controlled `codex --version` probes reproduced the lifecycle exactly.
  The first exited without warning but left one unlocked nonempty helper
  directory. The second emitted `Directory not empty (os error 39)`, converted
  the first residue to an empty no-lock directory, and left a new unlocked
  nonempty helper directory. Both probe residues were quarantined and removed
  through `/home/rioyokota/.codex/tmp/arg0-probe-cleanup-20260722.manifest`;
  that manifest was also exact-unlinked after verification.
- This matches the upstream janitor's lock lifetime: it keeps the acquired
  `.lock` file open while recursively deleting its directory. On this NFS
  filesystem the open file prevents the final directory removal. This is a
  confirmed local mechanism, not merely an accumulation symptom.
- The smallest deterministic workaround that preserves current processes is a
  version-scoped launcher wrapper: retain the exact official binary, move only
  unlocked prior-session directories to a private quarantine while holding
  their locks, invoke the official binary, then guarded-delete the quarantine.
  Installing that wrapper mutates vendor-managed launcher bytes and must not
  proceed without the owner's explicit choice. An official upgrade may replace
  it safely but would require revalidation if the upstream defect remains.

**Next exact action:** after owner authorization, design the wrapper and its
rollback first, add focused concurrency/NFS-simulation tests, run the phase-one
suite, and only then install it locally without stopping any running Codex
process.

### T-196 — Backup lifecycle phase 2

**Phase/status:** policy-resolved; execution remains gated on eight successful
weekly chains, two verified restores per node, and a current independent
generation. Progress is 1/8 everywhere.

| Node | Recorded 2026-07-26 successor |
| --- | --- |
| local | 91840 |
| ab | 2048464.pbs1 |
| ab2 | 2048468.pbs1 |
| ri | 7242 |
| rc | 212389 |
| t4 | 8194556 |
| al | 4238363 |

On or after eligibility, identity-match and query only these IDs. Record
terminal success, snapshot succession, warning silence, and chain count. Delay
is healthy; do not replace a pending job. Keep-all remains effective. No
forget, prune, recurring check/restore, or replica automation is authorized.
Evidence remains in docs/backup-lifecycle-phase2.md, docs/home-backup.md, and
docs/audits/restic-first-weekly-2026-07-19.md.

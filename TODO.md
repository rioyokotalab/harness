# Personal harness task board

This board owns planned and active work for the portable Codex and Claude
harness. Repository-specific tasks remain in their own project ledgers.

## Active

- **T-170 — Mirror the working environment across configured clusters:**
  1. Enumerate only concrete host aliases from the current node's SSH config
     and probe them non-interactively through the user's unlocked SSH agent.
     Use strict host-key checking, short timeouts, and a no-op remote command;
     do not copy keys, credentials, or other authentication material.
  2. Record which aliases pass, which fail at name resolution, routing,
     host-key verification, authentication, or remote command execution, and
     identify intentional non-cluster aliases separately.
  3. For reachable clusters, inventory only the portable environment surfaces
     the user approves (harness checkout, shell/tool configuration, package
     manifests, client discovery links, and version facts). Never copy secrets,
     live client state, caches, sessions, histories, or machine-specific paths.
  4. Define a declarative source of truth, per-cluster differences, dry-run
     synchronization, rollback, and validation before changing any remote.
  5. Apply changes only after the user reviews the inventory and synchronization
     plan; verify each cluster independently and preserve intentional local
     differences.

  Updated connectivity checkpoint (2026-07-14, current node, 11 aliases):

  - Clean non-interactive remote-command success: `ab`, `ab2`, `ai4s`, `rc`,
    `si`, `t4` (6).
  - `abci_login` is an acceptable proxy-only endpoint: its own session closes,
    but both downstream aliases `ab` and `ab2` pass through it.
  - `al` has the documented CSCS structure: its target is under
    `*.alps.cscs.ch`, it uses `ProxyJump alps_login`, an identity file, and
    `IdentitiesOnly yes`; `alps_login` resolves to Ela. Both currently fail at
    Ela with `Permission denied (publickey)`. CSCS requires a CSCS-signed key,
    whose default validity is one day, so renew/sign and load that key before
    retrying. Source: <https://docs.cscs.ch/access/ssh/>.
  - `github` is reachable/authenticated and correctly behaves as a restricted
    non-cluster Git service.
  - `web` reaches SSH without a transport error, but both `true` and a marker
    command exit 1 without output. It is not usable for environment inventory
    unless this is an intentional restricted service or its remote shell is
    repaired.

  Next step: renew the CSCS-signed key and clarify whether `web` intentionally
  disallows remote commands; then rerun those two paths before inventorying the
  six clean cluster shells.

## Planned

- **T-169 — Research advanced agent harness practices:**
  1. Freeze the present harness behavior and define evaluation criteria:
     correctness, autonomy, context efficiency, recovery, security,
     observability, portability, and measurable cost/runtime impact.
  2. In bounded research sessions, collect advanced public `CLAUDE.md` and
     `AGENTS.md` examples, including any authentic Karpathy material, from
     original repositories or authors. Record provenance, license, intended
     environment, and exact mechanisms instead of copying unattributed text.
  3. Review primary literature and authoritative technical reports on agentic
     planning, tool use, memory, delegation, verification, reflection,
     long-horizon execution, and multi-agent coordination. Confirm titles,
     authors, venue/year, and stable URLs, DOIs, or arXiv identifiers.
  4. Map each mechanism against the current harness's ledger, delegation,
     validation, safety, and portability behavior. Classify it as already
     covered, adopt, adapt, experiment, or reject, with benefits, failure
     modes, context/runtime cost, and evidence strength.
  5. Produce a cited source inventory, harness gap analysis, prioritized
     implementation proposals, and isolated benchmark designs.
  6. Independently verify material claims, separate evidence from inference,
     avoid license-incompatible copying, and turn approved proposals into
     bounded follow-up tasks with rollback and acceptance tests.

Do not modify the harness from research findings until the user reviews the
research plan and proposed changes.
